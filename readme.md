# jsonsite

- c#、restfull api、grunt、less

- visual studio 2015、sqlite(database driver of redis、mongodb、mssql will be supported for later)


## Plan & Thinking

- this project will be converted to **.net core** for demonstrating to my web front end team.

- nodejs is so slow to run the web, but easy to use & deploy.

- why the java Netty is sooooooo fast?
